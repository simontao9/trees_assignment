This means that the splits may be made very specifically on the train set, and do not generalize well on other data.

Also, we may be able to tell if a tree is underfitting if the splits make the subsequent populations too pure."

    "If the rating agency is included as a feature/covariate/predictor variable, the accuracy improved from the previous model (the accuracy jumped up to about 96.7%). This can lead to the interpretation that rating agency is likely correlated with the observed rating. The increased accuracy indicates that the model with rating agencies performs better because it can take into account how certain agencies tend to give ratings."
